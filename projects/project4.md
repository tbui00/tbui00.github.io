## Description:
The Roomniverse web application serves to help UH community members that attend UH campus to find a roommate. Roomniverse offers users to make requests
which allows them to describe the location they are in and what kind of roommate they are looking for. It also serves as a place to communicate with
others by posting messages or photos to share with the community what you are thinking of. To add, you are able to view other profiles and take a look 
at their related posts and requests that they put out. 

## Role:
This was a group project with a total of five members including myself. I was respondsible for mainly the User Profile page which should show the profile
of the users that are registered within the Roomniverse application. I created the tabular set up for the User's profile so that they can post on their
profile and a request tab page which displays only the reqeusts that they've made. I also implemented the Admin page which can only be access when logged in
as an admin user. The admin account has the ability to view all activity on one page in the Admin Page and they are able to edit,add,and delete anything. 
This permission is not allowed for regular users. 

## Learned Experience:
This was the final project which therefore is heavily weighed on our grade. Throughout the semester we needed to use the sections that we learned from 
compiled all the information together to be able to create this web application. We were given the tools and practiced it enough to be ready for this 
final project. With group projects it may be more difficult as everyone has their own schedules and lifestyles that they run. It may be hard to get
everyone to meet at the same time to dicuss about what our tasks should be. I also learned that this project had to be worked on towards the end of the 
semester and so many people struggled with balancing other final exams and this final project. I feel that communication is key when working in groups
and helps everyone be on the same page. Using the GitHub project board helped divide the tasks amongst each other so that no one overlapped in doing
work.
