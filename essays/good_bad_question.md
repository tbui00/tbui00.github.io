There are many moments in our life where we are working on a problem, get stuck, and need some insight in order to figure out a solution. There are a wide variety of ways where you can seek for a solution such as from your textbook, an article, or from an individual. More likely than not, receiving help from an individual aids you in learning more about the problem and why the solution came to be that way. The way we can seek for help can be done through many different methods, considering how the access to online resources are readily available in a matter of mere seconds. A common resource is visiting the website Stack Overflow which follows a forum format in which you can post your question or find a question similar to what you are looking for and refer to many different answers from individuals around the world. This kind of community-based forum allows you to possibly find a question that someone else has already asked as well. This kind of practice does not only have to be done through Stack Overflow but can be applied to other resources when looking online as well. In this way, you are efficiently saving time for yourself and for others if you are able to find a question that someone has already asked and was provided with a good answer. 

## What makes a bad question, bad?
When utilizing the Stack Overflow application as a resource for finding an answer your question or problem, you will notice that users have an option to upvote or downvote the question and answer(s) provided. This allows other viewers and the person who asked the question be able to assess whether the question and solution is effective as to what other users were looking for in an answer. 

Let us take a look at an example of what an ineffective question looks like. For this question, a user sets the title of the question as "simple javascript help." This title does not really narrow down what the issue is except that we know it is supposedly "simple" and it is regarding Javascript. The question gives a description that mentions he is new to Javascript and goes right into what he wants his program to do. The user does not describe at all how his current program works, his knowledge of the Javascript program, what he tried, and a definitive question that other users can focus on trying to answer. In essence, the description of the question is confusing and we are only provided with a block of code to work with. Due to this, many users have replied to the question unsure of what he is exactly looking for. One user made a comment on the question that states "Please clarify your question." There were three answers provided and the first answer that was given was also trying to clarify what he is looking for. The answer states "If you're asking how to find out what the value of an attribute in an element is" which then tells us that the question asked was unclear and the person trying to answer had to narrow down what the person was looking for. This question has one upvote but none of the answers themselves have an upvote. Moreover, the user who posted the question did not mark any of the three answers provided as an answer. Although this question was viewed 76 times, people did not find it insightful and the user does not think any of the answers was what he was looking for. As a result, this question is a good example of what an ineffective question looks like which shows how important it is to ask a good question in order to get a good answer to your solution.

## What does a good question look like?
Now that we know what an ineffective and bad question looks like, we can take a look at an example of what a good question looks like and how it is marginally different from the example we saw. This question has 2194 votes, has been viewed 555k times and has 17 different answers with the top answer having 1354 upvotes. We can see how much more feedback was given into this question compared to the previous question we just discussed. This question has the title of "How to decide when to use Node.js." The question itself provides a clear cut of what the user is asking for. In the description, the user informs that they are new however they have done their own extensive research before coming to Stack Overflow to formally ask the question. There is information on what they think is Node.js is and provided the resources that they used to learn about Node.js. The description is then followed up with why they are trying to understand Node.js and ends with a general question of "When to use a particular framework and what type of problems is it particularly suited for?" This allows people who view the question to also get an understanding of what Node.js and follow the resources that this user has provided in case they wanted to do research themselves. For the people who answered this question, they commended the user for doing such great research and ability to provide a summary of what they think Node.js is. Then they were able to give their own input of what Node.js is especially used for and how it is effective in its own way compared to PHP, Python, and Ruby. Many different users were able to answer this question giving their own input that provides insight to the overall discussion that this question has. We can see it clearly in the numbers where this forum was viewed about 555k times. On account of this, there is an apparent difference that we can see when asking a good or bad question which can lead to great discussions allowing users to learn or ending up with a unassertive answer to the question.
