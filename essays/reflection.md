As I reach the end of the semester of my ICS 314 (Software Engineering) class, I will go over what I have learned and gained over about fourth months. ICS 314 could be understood as a web development course on the surface but as I break down the pieces of what was taught, I can begin to realize that it is much more than a web development course. 

Throughout the course, there were a couple of fundamental software engineering concepts such as Open Source Software Development, Configuration Management, Functional Programming, Development Environments, Coding Standards, User Interface Frameworks, Agile Project Management, Design Patterns, and Ethics in Software Engineering. However, I will be going over the following topics as this sparked these sparked the most interest for me: Development Environments and Coding Standards.

## Development Environments: IntelliJ IDEA
Before I started this class, the IDE that I was using was required in my ICS 111 class which was Eclipse. I feel that although I was exposed to a good IDE, it wasn’t the one for me but I wasn’t sure where to look from then on since my previous courses were done in the terminal. When IntelliJ IDEA was going to be the IDE used for this course I was very excited as it was finally something new and different. I feel that I was able to navigate through it very easily and utilize a lot of the shortcuts. I also feel that it has a fresher feel and a more modernized look. In addition to using IntelliJ IDEA, as students, we are also given the option to download the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate version which gives us more access to all the great features which IntelliJ IDEA has to offer. I will continue to use IntelliJ IDEA in the future as one of my IDEs while I also discover more.

## Coding Standards is Key
Throughout this semester I have used and applied coding standards to my code and may have not realized it until the course went over coding standards as one of the sections. I feel that coding standards is one of the most fundamental topics that computer science people should learn about and apply in their work. A huge page of code that follows coding standards compared to one that doesn’t make a difference for readability when others are reading the code. In this course when coding Javascript the students were required to use ESLint to check if their code followed the coding standards expected. I feel that this helped improve my coding skills in terms of readability and also helped out with the instructor and teaching assistant in being able to grade everyone’s work quicker. The ESLint program actively checked for errors, what was wrong, and how it can be fixed. 

I always knew that coding standards were important because you want your code to be clean and readable however it made me think about coding standards, even more, when I started working in a group for the final project. We all commit and make pull requests to the main branch a lot and so a lot of code is being passed through. When issues were occurring in the code and the application wasn’t working, we had to read through the code to figure out what was wrong. While reading through the code, I did stumble upon code work that another teammate did which caught my attention. This code worked perfectly fine however how it was typed gave me a bit of trouble to see what the code is trying to do. This made me realize the importance of coding standards even more and that I should always remember to apply coding standards when I can.
