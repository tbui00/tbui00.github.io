## Semantic UI Usage
This course has begun introducing the idea of UI Frameworks and how we can start creating our webpages using the UI Framework, Semantic UI to do so. Before this section, we were only using HTML and CSS to code our web pages as an introduction to how to create web pages. These web pages although worked, would require a lot more coding to create a responsive environment. This is quite clear when comparing just HTML and CSS alone and then using Semantic UI with HTML and CSS. The amount of code required to create a responsive website can be easily done using Semantic UI in comparison to trying to do this only with HTML and CSS. 

Semantic UI is one of the many development frameworks that is used to help create beautiful responsive layouts on websites quickly. It allows you to set up responsive design and making it feel like a breeze. There are variations of designs that are built into elements allowing for a wide variety of customization. Not only that but with responsive design, you can design your websites and not have to worry about the page adjustments on smaller screens such as mobile and tablet screens. The focus when developing websites can now be more on the design and content rather than spending a lot of time trying to make sure your code functions on different screens. 


## Personal experience with Semantic UI 
When I first used Semantic UI I was shocked at how typing some simple words can easily help you manipulate the page to your liking. It almost seemed too easy in comparison to only using HTML and CSS. I sometimes have to double-check to see, "is that it?" Although you do need to learn the framework to take full advantage of what it has to offer, this opens the door to so many more possibilities within your webpage. Just using certain grid configurations allows a wide variety of ways where one can set up their webpage. I am oftentimes surprised that some of the classes that I put in help create so much of the webpage for me. To add, it helped me focus a lot more on the customization of the design, such as how precise I want to be with the layout. Aesthetics are very important to me, and now I feel like I can focus on practicing the design aspect rather than figuring how to make it work properly. 

I am still in the process of learning Semantic UI and therefore I don't have a full grasp on how I can fully take advantage of the resources. Some trouble I've had is understanding how to maximize the grid and making the grid stretch to the ends of the pages. This is a design choice that a webpage I was trying to replicate. One thing I like about Semantic UI so far is how easy it is to adjust your website with just a few words. Not only that but you are also able to input icons very easily by just typing a few words. If you wanted to use the Facebook icon, it would look something like `<i class="facebook f icon"></i>`. This is much easier in comparison with having to upload a picture of the Facebook icon and then re-adjusting its size so that it is the same as all the other icons. I am looking forward to learning more about Semantic UI and how I can use it to my advantage.  

## Why go through the trouble to learn?
Is it worth going through the trouble to learn another framework? Yes, it is. Not only are you expanding your knowledge of how to use different applications and frameworks, but you are also giving yourself less work to do if utilizing the frameworks correctly. Semantic UI is supposed to help design websites quickly and allow more room for customization. Limiting yourself to using only HTML and CSS can be cumbersome and time-consuming. It can be necessary at times when you want to exploit the presence of a certain feature. However, in today's world, it is more convenient when you have a web page that can run on all sorts of platforms and environments at the same time. I don't think I will only go back to only using HTML and CSS to create websites when I know there is a framework out there that can help me create more creative and beautiful websites with much more ease.
