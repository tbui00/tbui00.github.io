## Why do I like Computer Science?
As a person who was really into art since a young child and even today, it is a big switch in my life where I made the change from pursuing an Arts degree to a Computer Science degree. I was also into computers and playing games at a very young age. Therefore my exposure to computers was relatively the same as the amount of time I spent learning about art and doing art. My exploration of software engineering has only begun yet I find myself having a lot of fun every day being able to satisfyingly solve problems on my own. There is much fulfillment in being able to complete a project and having it function the way you want it to. I still love and admire the many fine arts around the world and will continue to do this practice on my own time as a hobby. However, software engineering spiked my interest in computers overall. I feel that my experience as a software engineer is small yet full of potential to discover many new and fun things in the technological world. 

## Where do I see myself as a Software Engineer?
The main three or four words that come into my head whenever I am asked to describe my interests are games, art, sustainability, and computers. I do consider the many pathways I could take with software engineering; programming at a video game company or part take in a sustainable organization to assist in being part of a group that is trying to make the world a better place. I feel that I can express my more creative and artistic side if I were to work at a video game company. However, I place sustainability as a very crucial priority in my life where being environmentally friendly is extremely prevalent in 2021. I feel that if I can do my part as a software engineer to make the world slowly but surely becoming environmentally sustainable or safe, I would be so proud of myself that I am doing something for the betterment of society. Whichever path I do decide to land on, I know that I will have many opportunities to do both and many more should I take further interest in something else. 

## What skills and experiences are there to gain?
I do consider myself as a relatively new programmer and therefore have a lot of information to gain and learn as programming will be a lifelong experience so long as I choose to stick with it. I just finished and passed ICS 311 during the summer of 2021 which is the bane of many ICS majors at UH Manoa. I am currently taking ICS 314 to be one step closer to my degree in Computer Science. These two courses are said to be the main turning point for some students who are pursuing the ICS degree depending on whether they pass or not. I feel that I would like to gain a lot of experience in critical thinking and being able to solve more problems on my own. Training your brain to understand what the problem is asking for and how to effectively utilize your time to create a positive outcome is important. Another skill I hope to gain is being able to communicate effectively with other peers using technical terms when working on a project. Having a wide variety of knowledge and understanding how technical terms are relative to what you are doing is crucial and will help you better understand what the computer is doing. When taking courses such as the algorithmic course (ICS 311), how the lectures are taught is very formal in that they utilize technical terms and knowledge that can be difficult for many to understand. As for the experience, I would like to gain all the experience that I can be given the opportunity to. The programming and computer science world is so vast and constantly growing, I feel that being able to learn bits and pieces of this kind of community will help me grow as a software engineer and allow me to gain a better understanding of technology.
