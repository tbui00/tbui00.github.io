## First Impressions on RadGrad
My first encounter with RadGrad was not through the ICS 314 class that I am currently taking now but was actually through the ICS 211 course that I have taken in the past about one year ago. I was taking the course with Professor Moore and I think he is also one of the main developers of the RadGrad website. During that time I also went through the same RadGrad New User tutorial in which I needed to create my account and complete the high priorities at the time. At that time, I was still on the edge of whether or not I wanted to commit to pursuing a degree in computer science. Therefore, seeing this website at that time helped me to see what kind of interests I had matched up with the courses or opportunities out there. At that time, it also helped take some of the uneasiness off my shoulders because I thought that going into computer science means there are only careers related to coding. I gained new insight into how much of a variety computer science can offer. 

## Discoveries through RadGrad
Since I had used RadGrad in the past, I was able to put in my interests, career goals, courses, and opportunities at the time. Looking at the page now it is like I'm looking at the history of myself from the past and what kinds of interests that I had back then. It was interesting to see what interests I put in the past and compare them to the interests that I put in now. In the past, I was still new to computer science since I had only taken two ICS courses (ICS 111 and ICS 211). The options that I selected were more likely taken at a glance to see what fit my interests the most at the time but not thinking deeper in how it ties into computer science as a whole. I have expanded my knowledge about computer science after taking multiple classes after ICS 211. Therefore, I can get a better sense of what kind of things I preferred although I still have many more courses to go to. 

An interest that I chose in the past but not anymore is AI. I was interested in AI in the past because I thought "wow, that sounds cool, creating artificial intelligence?"  Now, I am still intrigued by the idea of AI however the idea is very daunting to me. The idea of "flexible rational agents that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at an arbitrary goal" seems extremely advance. I feel that I am not ready for that kind of expertise but I am not closed off to it either. An interest that stayed the same from the beginning till now is Sustainability. I feel that sustainability is a high priority in my life and something that I am more than willing to pursue in the future. So I am kind of proud of myself for selecting this in the past and maintaining this interest now. An interest that was not here in the past but added now is Computer Architecture. After joining the computer science program, I learned that I want to know more about the structures of computers and how it all comes together to make a functioning computer. Therefore, I am looking forward to understanding the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems in the future. With RadGrad, I can select classes that are more directed towards my interests. 

## Continue to use RadGrad?
When I first used RadGrad, I was still young in the program and did not know much about what kinds of opportunities were out there. I selected my interest but did I know what was going on? Now that I am in ICS 314, I have a better understanding of the scene and what kinds of things I can be looking for. I feel that since I know more of what I want,  I can use RadGrad to help me join different groups or participate in different activities to further benefit myself for the future industries. I am hoping to find more opportunities geared towards sustainability, graphic design, or within the game design realm. I can't wait to see what kind of path I will lead by the end of my college career with the help of RadGrad.
