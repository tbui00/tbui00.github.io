For this ICS 414 course, the students were formed into 4 groups with about 7 students in each group. Our task for the semester was to work with a real customer that has requested what they want out of this project. The customers were from the C. S. Wo company and had a website that they initially made. The purpose of this website was to help connect volunteers and organizations in Hawaii so that they can get insight and sign up for opportunities around the island. We worked on creating similar websites in each group with our designs that still followed the same principles and functionally that the customers had on their websites. Moreover, groups would implement additional features that the customer was looking for or something we thought would enhance the website. 

## An Unfamiliar Structure
To me, this course was a prequel to the course ICS 314 since we used all the information we learned in ICS 314 and applied it to ICS 414. Although part of this is true, I found that this course was much more intensive in terms of creating the database as a whole. We needed to create different collections for each aspect of each person in the database. For example, in the previous course when a person had properties such as sports, hobbies, favorite food, and favorite animal. There would be a collection of people where one person would have a unique key ID that would help filter out and find out all the other properties. However, in ICS 414 this was not the case. Instead, there would be multiple collections where the person would have a unique key ID, but all the other properties would also be their collections. In these collections, it would contain the item and be connected to a unique key ID. This was initially hard to wrap around since it would mean that much more files would need to be created, and connecting them all seemed complex. With the help of one of our group members, they created a very large diagram that shows how all of the collections are connected. Below is an image of what our understanding of the database structure looks like visually.

## Hybrid Course During Covid
The code that we produced throughout this semester was primarily done at home in the comfort of our own homes. However, the instructor for our class had designated a room on campus that allows the students to meet in class every Tuesday and Thursday with a little over 1 hour of class time. We would do code reviews and milestones in which we would showcase what we had so far until the very end of the semester. This class was the first class since March 2020 in which I was able to sit in a class again full of students and it was also the only class this semester in which I needed to go on campus. Through this experience, it was the first time in a while that I was able to communicate with other students in-person about group work. This in-person environment was foreign to everyone in the classroom for the first couple of weeks. However, over time we grew comfortable working together with our masks on. 

My group in particular would consistently come to campus to meet in person every week. This was surprising to all of us as most groups usually don't make much of an effort to meet in person as often. However, this in-person class time designated to allow groups to work together in person would presumably help the groups communicate better. This indeed did help my group communicate effectively in person as we were able to talk about the issues that we faced and review our code together. Although group work can be difficult as the work tends to not be distributed evenly, I found that communicating in person with my group twice a week helped everyone understand who was doing what and keep us on the same page.
